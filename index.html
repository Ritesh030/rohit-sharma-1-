    <h2>Early life</h2><hr class="ael">
    <img class="EI" src="download (2).jpeg" >
    <p class="EL">
        <span class="s1">Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.[4] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low </span>income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.[6] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[7] His mother tongue is Telugu.

Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma's old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in my cricket".[7] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[8]

        <h2>Playing style</h2><hr class="aps">
        <img class="pull-img" src="download (3).jpeg" >
        <p class="p1">
            Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance.[96][97] He is usually an opening batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket as a middle-order batsman.[98][99] In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as one of the format's most outstanding batsmen.[100][101] And for his attacking batting and six hitting abilities he often referred as Hitman.[102]
        </p><p class="p2">
Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv Richards. In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:[103]
</p ><p class="p3">
The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma. Like Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for big hundreds. When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.
</p><p>
While Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right arm off spin.[4] He usually fields in the slips and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.[104]

    <h2>Achievements</h2><hr class="aa">
    <img class="roar-img" src="download (4).jpeg" >
    <p class="p51">
        Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match, with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on November 13, 2014.[4] He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket.[105] In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[106] During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.[107]
</p><p>
On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[108] In the same series, he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.[109]
</p><p>
On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553).[110] His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.[111]
</p><p>
On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.[112] This feat occurred during a highly anticipated India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 1 lakh enthusiastic fans.[113] The Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant Strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.
</p><p>
On the 22nd of October 2023, during a thrilling encounter against New Zealand, Rohit Sharma, fondly known as the 'Hitman,' etched his name in the annals of cricket history. In a remarkable feat, he became the first Indian batter to smash 50 One Day International (ODI) sixes in a single calendar year.[114] This incredible display of power-hitting is a testament to Rohit's batting prowess and his ability to dominate the limited-overs format. With each mighty swing of his bat, Rohit Sharma continues to redefine the boundaries of achievement and captivate cricket enthusiasts around the world, solidifying his status as one of the most prolific and electrifying batters in the game.

    <h2>Philanthropy</h2><hr>
    <p>
        Sharma engages in numerous philanthropic activities, promoting various causes such as animal welfare, health, and children.[126] He is particularly vocal about the protection of animals and has supported various initiatives and organisations to promote the cause.[127]
</p><p>
In February 2015, Sharma joined <strong>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</strong> (PETA) to support sterilisation of homeless cats and dogs. When supporting the cause Sharma said, "Sterilisation is important because I feel that if we can stop (the homeless-animal crisis), there will be control of population among the street dogs".[128]
</p><p>
In September 2015, along with Hollywood actors Matt LeBlanc and Salma Hayek, Sharma joined an anti-poaching campaign in Kenya to save the wild animals of Africa including the last surviving northern white rhinoceros. When joining the campaign Sharma said, "I have been a member of PETA and when I was informed about the cause, I thought it is my duty to join the anti-poaching drive. That's what got me to Nairobi. I was fascinated to have a look at Sudan (the last northern white rhino) and the sniffer dogs who catch hold of the poachers".[129]
</p><p>
In November 2017, Sharma in a video on social media said that he had agreed with an online store to merchandise mobile phone covers and other items that would use his name and ODI jersey no. 45. Sharma also told his Twitter followers: "All proceeds from your purchases would go to an animal charity of my choice".[130]
</p><p>
In 2018 on "World Rhino Day", Sharma was announced as the WWF-India Rhino Ambassador. Ravi Singh, the CEO and Secretary General of WWF-India, said "We welcome Rohit into the WWF family". After taking a pledge for the cause of rhino conservation, Sharma said, "My love for rhinos sparked when I first heard about Sudan, the last male northern white African rhino who died this year thus leading to the inevitable extinction of the entire species and that broke my heart. As the world and I mourned for my fallen friend Sudan, I researched the best way for me to help prevent something like this happening and the best way I know how is to create awareness. After getting in touch with WWF I learnt that 82% of the world’s rhinos reside in India and I am honoured to be WWF-India’s rhino ambassador to spread awareness and do my bit to contribute to the protection and survival of the rhino and help make this world a better place for them."[131]
